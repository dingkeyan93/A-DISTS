# Locally Adaptive DISTS

This is the pytorch implementation of the paper [Locally Adaptive Structure and Texture Similarity for Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08521) â€” an extension of [DISTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07728), which separates structure and texture across space and scale, and assigns the adaptive weights to quality measurements according to local image content.
